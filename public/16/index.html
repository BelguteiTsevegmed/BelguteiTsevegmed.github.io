<p>Caro-Kann Defence - Wikipedia
The Caro-Kann Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves: 1. e4 c6. The Caro-Kann is a common defence against the King&rsquo;s Pawn Opening. It is classified as a Semi-Open Game, like the Sicilian Defence and French Defence, although it is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than either of those openings.)
