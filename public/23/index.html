<p>Elephant Gambit - Chess Pathways
The Elephant Gambit is a rare response to the King&rsquo;s Pawn Opening - and it&rsquo;s rare for a reason! The opening is characterized by the first moves 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5?! Black&rsquo;s attempt to grab the full center could be seen as ambitious, but black simply doesn&rsquo;t have the development needed to justify this pawn thrust.)

<p>Elephant Gambit: Chess Opening&rsquo;s Lines - ChessDoctrine.com
The Elephant Gambit starts with the King&rsquo;s Pawn Opening (1.e4), and after Black responds with 1…e5, White develops the g1-Knight to f3 (2.Nf3).Then, Black offers a pawn by advancing the d-pawn forward (2…d5).This opening is not considered a reliable gambit because Black typically does not get enough compensation for the lost pawn.)

<p>Elephant Gambit Chess Opening - ChessEasy
Elephant Gambit Chess Opening. Elephant Gambit is a King&rsquo;s Pawn Opening that starts with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d5. Black&rsquo;s second move looks logical from the perspective of opening principles. Black moves his center pawn challenges opponent&rsquo;s center pawn and opens up a way for his bishop. But this opening doesn&rsquo;t really work too well for black.)
