Overview. The Réti Opening is a chess opening where White wants to control the center from the wings rather than by direct occupation. The idea: White wants to attack Black&rsquo;s d5-pawn under attack from the flank. White will do this by playing his bishop on the long diagonal (g3 and Bg2) to create pressure on the light squares in the center.)
