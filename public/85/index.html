<p>The Tennison Gambit- How to Play it as White and Black
The Tennison Gambit is a trick opening that will only cause problems for Black if they play inaccurately. The ICBM is a dangerous trap, but it is easily refuted. It can be a fun trick to use in bullet and blitz chess against beginners, but advanced players are not likely to fall into such traps.)

The lesser-known Tennison Gambit is initiated with the seemingly calm and collected starting move of the Reti Opening, 1.Nf3, but the Flank Opening takes a surprising turn after 1…d5 with the move 2.e4.This opening bears resemblance to the Englund Gambit played by black, but with reversed colors. The key difference is that white utilizes the extra tempo gained by developing the knight to f3.)
