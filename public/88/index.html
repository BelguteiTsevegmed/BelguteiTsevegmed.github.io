<p>Queen&rsquo;s Gambit Opening: Lines &amp; Traps on ChessDoctrine.com
About Queen&rsquo;s Gambit. It is one of the oldest chess openings in existence, with its origins dating all the way back to the 15th century. White&rsquo;s main idea with the move 2.c2-c4 is to develop the queenside Knight with the move Nb1-c3, but this would be rather cumbersome if the Knight were standing in front of the pawn.)

1.d4 d5 2.c4. The Queen&rsquo;s Gambit is one of the oldest and most reputable 1.d4 openings for White. Unlike 1.e4 openings, the Queen&rsquo;s Gambit usually evolves into a strategic game rather than an all-out tactical battle.
